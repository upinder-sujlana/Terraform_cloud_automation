Files associated with the demo I did for my team about cloud (AWS and GCP fundamentals) and terraform.

Firstly walked the team through, how to go about creating a S3 bucket a EC2 instance in AWS.

Followed by automating the creation of the task of the S3 and two EC2 instances using the terraform automation.
